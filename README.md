RITUALS  

What you think, you become  
First, think, second, act (think =/= plan. think === create)  
Then, we are what we do everyday.  

So, i have to create habits? No  
I have to differenciate this concepts before:  
Habit is a simple action that i can do without think  
Ritual is a complex action that needs a primitive  
belief to be done.  

I don't understand...  

Ok, let me explain.  
Rituals implies fear to god if you don't do the action
And that primitive fear, helps to mantain the attention,  
that's why since the beggining of the human story  
people do that (there are rituals that last days and  
people who practice it still remember what to do without  
any kind of technology)  
Requirement, believe in the consequences  

System is the enviroment where Habit & Ritual live  
The next following system is what i am doing:

DAPP MARKETPLACE 1  
  
I gonna build a marketplace using NextJS.  
I've just only created the project and i
formatted the project in order to clean it.
  
I did this first command to create the project:  
  
    npx create-next-app@latest marketplace-eth
    
Then i deleted files and folders:  

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─api
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        ├─Home.css
        └─globals.css

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        └─globals.css

In index.js i only left this code:

    export default function Home() {
    return (
            <>
                Hello You
            </>
        )
    }

I have to wait till tomorrow in order to continue
