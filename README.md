DAPP MARKETPLACE 1  
  
I gonna build a marketplace using NextJS   
  
I've just only created the project and i
formatted the code in order to clean it
  
I did this, is the first command to create the project:  
  
    npx create-next-app@latest nameOfTheProject
    
Mine is marketplace-eth. then i deleted files like that:

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─api
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        ├─Home.css
        └─globals.css

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        └─globals.css

And i modified the index.js like this:

    export default function Home() {
    return (
            <>
                Hello You
            </>
        )
    }

I have to wait till tomorrow in order to continue
