RITUALS  

What you think, you become  
First, think, second, act  
(think is not planning, is create in this case)    
Then, we are what we do everyday.  

So, i have to create habits? No  
I have to differenciate this concepts before:  
Habit is a simple action that i can do without think  
Ritual is a complex action that needs a primitive  
belief to be done.  

I don't understand...  

Ok, let me explain.  
Rituals implies fear to god if you don't do the action  
And this primitive fear, helps me to mantain the attention,  
that's why since the beggining of the human story people do  
that (there are rituals that last days and people who  
practice it still remember what to do without any kind of  
technology)  
Requirement, believe in the consequences, don't sin

System is the enviroment where Habit & Ritual live.  
The next following system is what i am doing:

MARKETPLACE 1  
  
I gonna build a dapp marketplace using NextJS.  
I've just only created the project and i formatted the  
project in order to clean it.  
  
I did this first command to create the project:  
  
    npx create-next-app@latest marketplace-eth
    
Then i deleted files and folders:  

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─api
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        ├─Home.css
        └─globals.css

    marketplace-eth
    ├─pages
    │  ├─_app.js
    │  └─index.js
    └─styles
        └─globals.css

In index.js i only left this code:

    export default function Home() {
    return (
            <>
                Hello You
            </>
        )
    }

I have to wait till tomorrow in order to continue.

I have to focus and study, but i got trapped with the 
pleasure again, i can't be alone without falling down.

The only solution is expose myself in public to
avoid get distracted, and also calculate how much money
will cost me that (on top of that, insecurity of got rob), maybe the wallet punch can help me.
Pay my mom each time that i unfocus to force myself, sounds a good idea.

Countradictions, is incredible how common are, 
double-thinking is in front of me but i can't avoid it.

Depression ? No problems for now.
Loneliness ? No partner for now.
Unclear plan ? Study and practice english, nothing more.
I dont feel passion for nothing ? We got it
mmm, a hobbie could fill that hole.
but...
There is a noscreen nomad notloud lowequipment hobbie to do it offline ?

Dance: not interested really, i did it to impress.
Chess: there are more complex board games.

Pen spinning: Cool but useless.
Ham Radio: many equipment.
Druid: write down what you learn about it.
