[;1] RITUALS  

What you think, you become  
First, think, second, act  
(think is not planning, is create in this case)  
Then, we are what we do everyday.  

So, i have to create habits? No  
I have to differenciate this concepts before:  
Habit is a simple action that i can do without think.  
Ritual is a complex action that needs a primitive belief to be done.  

I don't understand...  

Ok, let me explain.  
Rituals implies fear to god if you don't do the action And this primitive fear, helps me to mantain the attention, that's why since the beggining of the human story people do that (there are rituals that last days and people who practice it still remember what to do without any kind of technology)  
Requirement, believe in the consequences, don't sin.  

System is the enviroment where Habit & Ritual live.  
The next following system is what i am doing:  
habit & (ritual)  

make my bed  
(meditate)  
calisthenics  
mop rooms  
shower

[;2] EMPTINESS

I have to focus and study, but i got trapped with the pleasure again, i can't be alone without falling down.  

The only solution is expose myself in public to avoid get distracted, and also calculate how much money will cost me that (on top of that, insecurity of got rob, maybe the wallet punch can help me.  
Pay my mom each time that i unfocus to force myself, sounds a good idea.  

Countradictions, is incredible how common are, double-thinking is in front of me but i can't avoid it.  

Depression ? No problems for now.  
Loneliness ? No partner for now.  
Unclear plan ? Study and practice english.  
I dont feel passion for nothing ? We got it !!!  
mmm, a hobbie could fill that hole.  
but...  
There is a noscreen loudless little equipment hobbie to do it offline ?  

Hobbies that i don't want to do:  
Instrument: what i want it's not portable (piano).  
Sing / Rap: it's annoying for people who live with me.  
Dance: not interested really, i did it to impress.  
Chess: there are more complex board games.  
Origami: i have to watch videos. tutorials can be printed, but you will need a printer (no portable).  
Bike: even worse, they can kill you for a bike, yes.  
Yoga: i don't like it.  
Gardening: i't not portable unfortunately.  
Cooking: i don't like to cook more than i need.  
Pen spinning: Cool but useless.  
Ham Radio: many equipment.  
Druid: write down what you learn about it.  
Miniature Aquascaping: research. many equipment  
Jewelry Making: i want to make a it for fun, not money.

Mini Drawing: i need a book and pen.  
Go: i like but i don't want to play it online. Thu  
Walk: due the insecurity i have to go to downtown, i can use the free bus card to do it. Mon, Wed, Fri  


[;3] NEW STUDY METHOD

I've started to study in the library and i realized than the efficency goes up.  
i can finish a chapter in 3 ~ 2 hours, insane. Usually each chapter took me all day if i study in the apartment due the loud neighbors, constructions, my thoughts that interrupts me, and the fact of people studying around helps me to focus more.  
Cannot get distracted it sounds good, the only way to deal with procrastination is not to have option.  

And now i have more time to spend in some hobbie.  
I will try some this month.

[;5] BUS PROBLEM

There are many libraries in my city that i didn't know that exist.  
I will try to go to each in order to not get bored, and are free.  

I other news, takuzu is a excellent puzzle but is easy by the size.  
Maybe i can increase the size from 8x8 to 12x12 and try what happend.  

And also is quite hard to write in the bus, even sit, streets condition are shit.  
I have to do something in the bus, besides watch the windows or the people in there.  
What activity can i do while i am in a earthquake-bus ?  
Origami, rubic, draw, sing, play instrument, play on the phone. 
Based on cheapness, loudness, screenless the winner is Origami.
What i have to do then ?  
I have to do it before in order to replicate it in the bus without screen.
